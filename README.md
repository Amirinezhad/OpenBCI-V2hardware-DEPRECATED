WELCOME!

Welcome to OpenBCI's Github.  This is the place where we will keep the software that we want to share with the community and where we will keep the software that the community shares with us.

* Arduino:  Here are the Arduino libraries and sketches to help you run OpenBCI with an Arduino.  Currently, all development has been with the Arduino UNO.  We will expand to other Arduino platforms in the future.

* Processing GUI: Here are some Processing libraries and sketches to help you receive data from the Arduino/OpenBCI.  You can use these sketches to watch the data in real time.  Some of the sketches also log the data to disk so that you can analyze it after the test.
